# Do Disturb

A smart Android call-blocking app that integrates with Google Calendar to create time-based call filtering rules.

## Concept

**Do Disturb** flips the "Do Not Disturb" concept:

- **By default**: all incoming calls from numbers **not in your contacts** are blocked.
- **During calendar events**: calls from **all numbers** (including unknown) are temporarily allowed through.

If you have a calendar event like "Expecting delivery call," unknown callers will be let through for that time window. The app also manages the system-level Do Not Disturb mode automatically.

## How It Works

1. Complete the setup wizard (contacts, DND, call screening, Google Sign-In, notifications)
2. The app syncs events from a designated Google Calendar (default: `DoDisturb`) every 15 minutes
3. Calendar events become "allowed timeframes" stored locally
4. When a call arrives, the screening service checks:
   - Is blocking enabled?
   - Are we in an allowed timeframe?
   - Is the caller in contacts?
   - If none apply, the call is blocked and logged

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 34
- A Google account with Google Calendar

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ablanchard/do-disturb.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Sync Gradle and build the project.

4. **Set up Firebase** (required for crash reporting):
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project (or use an existing one)
   - Add an Android app with package name `com.dodisturb.app`
   - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `app/` directory
   - Crashlytics will start collecting crash reports and log breadcrumbs automatically

5. Create a Google Calendar named `DoDisturb` (or configure a different name in the app).

6. Run the app on a device or emulator (API 29+).

7. Follow the setup wizard to grant required permissions.

## Permissions

The app requires:

- **Contacts** -- to identify known callers
- **Do Not Disturb access** -- to manage system DND mode
- **Call screening role** -- to intercept and filter incoming calls
- **Google Sign-In** -- to read your Google Calendar (read-only)
- **Notifications** (Android 13+) -- to notify about blocked calls and sync errors

## Building

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
